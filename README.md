Sponges have been around for a very long time, with certain species having a fossil record that dates back approximately 600 million years to the earliest (Precambrian) period of Earthâ€™s history. 

Approximately 8,550 living sponge species are scientifically classified in the phylum Porifera, which is comprised of four distinct classes:

Demospongiae (the most diverse, containing 90 percent of all living sponges), 

Hexactinellida (the rare glass sponges), 

Calcarea (calcareous sponges), 

Homoscleromorpha (the rarest and simplest class, only recently recognized, with approximately 117 species).

Convolutional Neural Network Model is used to classify the images.
